# 🐍 My Python Journey

Welcome to my Python learning repository! I am currently a **BSCS student** and this space serves as a live log of my progress, coding exercises, and projects.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
* Master core Python syntax and logic.
* Implement Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python.
* Prepare a solid foundation for **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**.
* Transition from Web Development (React) to Full-Stack/AI integration.

## 📂 Repository Contents
* **Basics:** Variables, loops, and conditional statements (like my name input scripts!).
* **Labs:** Practice questions from my university coursework.
* **Projects:** Small scripts and logic-based games.

## 🚀 Future Goals
I plan to use these Python skills to dive into libraries like **NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn** for Data Science and AI applications.

*Follow my journey as I build my skills in the world of Computer Science!*
